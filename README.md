# Bladder Phantom
STL files for making a silicone bladder phantom. 
This is linked to a published article: Verstraeten M et al. Urinary bladder phantom mimicking mechanical properties and pressure during filling. Biomed Phys Eng Express. 2023 Jul 20;9(5). doi: 10.1088/2057-1976/ace449. PMID: 37406619. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37406619/)


The files in the repository are the STL files that can be used for 3D printing.
Two files for the outer mold, which can be printed using regular PLA and default settings.
The inner mold file must be 3D printed using a water soluble filament such as PVA or BVOH.

It is recommended to spray the inner parts of the outer mold with a mold release agent. The three parts can then be assembled using screws. If necessary, a layer of parafine can be applied to make the inner part hermetic due to the inaccuracy of the fit between the inner part and the outer mold. Silicone (Ecoflex 00-30) can be mixed, degassed and then poured into the main chimney. Ideally, the mold should be centrifuged under vacuum to limit the amount of air in the silicone. Once the silicone is reticulated, the outer mold can be disassembled and the inner mold with the silicone around it can be placed in a hot water bath for 24 hours, changing the water every 3 to 4 hours until the inner mold is completely dissolved. 

To best mimic a real bladder, sutures should be placed around the phantom and it should be filled to the desired cystometric capacity (e.g., 300 mL).
